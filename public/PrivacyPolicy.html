	<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
	<strong>Effective March 20, 2015</strong>
</p>
<p>
This Online and Mobile Privacy Policy ("<strong><em>Privacy Policy</em></strong>") explains how Lemmino, Inc. ("<strong><em>Lemmino</em></strong>," "	<strong><em>we,</em></strong>" "<strong><em>us,</em></strong>" or "<strong><em>our</em></strong>") collects, uses and discloses information, and applies to
	information we collect when you use or access our online or mobile Services (located at <em>www.lemmino.com)</em>, our products, our services or our
	applications (the Services, products and services are collectively referred to as the "<strong><em>Services</em></strong>" in this Privacy Policy), or when
	you otherwise interact with us.
</p>
<p>
	We respect the privacy rights of users and recognize the importance of protecting information collected about you. If you use the Services as part of an
	entity or organization that has an agreement with Lemmino (like your employer or other organization), the terms of that organization's agreement for the
	Services may restrict our collection or use of your information in addition to what is described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
	By using our Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please delete all
	cookies from your browser cache after visiting our Services and do not visit or use our Services. Your continued use of our Services will signify your
	acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
	If you are using the Services pursuant to a service agreement your business or organization has with us, then this Privacy Policy is integrated into and is
	a part of that agreement. In the event of any inconsistence between this Privacy Policy and your service agreement, your service agreement governs your
	relationship with us. Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning attributed to them in the Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1. Information We Collect And Use</strong>
</p>
<p>
	1.1 Personal Information
</p>
<p>
	The term "<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>" as used in this Privacy Policy refers to information that can be used to identify, locate, or
	contact an individual, including your name, username, email address, picture, postal address, phone number, employer's name, job title, transactional
	information (including services purchased or subscribed to and billing address), as well as any contact or other information you choose to provide. When
	you access the Services from a mobile device, we also collect information about the device, including location, hardware model, operating system and
	version, unique device identifiers, applications installed on the device, and mobile network information (as allowed by the mobile network) or platform
	information (as allowed by the specific platform type).
</p>
<p>
	It also includes other information that may be associated with Personal Information, such as an internet protocol ("<strong><em>IP</em></strong>") address,
	browser type, internet service provider, operating system, and device type. Personal Information does not include information that has been aggregated or
	made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person.
</p>
<p>
	Generally, we collect Personal Information when you provide it directly to us and through Services technology known as "cookies," as further described in
	Section 4 below. The types of information we collect, and our use of that information, depends on whether you are a visitor to or a registered user of our
	Services, and is further described below.
</p>
<p>
	1.2 Information We Collect From Registered Users
</p>
<p>
	In order to gain full access to the Services, you must first be granted permission to access the content of the individual or entity that has ordered
	service from Lemmino, as further described in your Service Agreement. We may collect certain types of information about you from the owner or administrator
	that is granting you access, including when you: (i) register with Lemmino for an account, (ii) create or modify your profile or online account, (iii)
	access and use our Services, (iv) participate in any interactive features of the Services, (v) participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes,
	activity or event, and (vi) make a purchase, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third-party social media sites or otherwise
	communicate with us.
</p>
<p>
	As a User, we will use the information you provide us to:
</p>
<p>
	(i) Identify and authenticate your account when you log in to the Services;
</p>
<p>
	(ii) Provide the products and services you have requested;
</p>
<p>
	(iii) Contact you about your use of the Services and to provide notifications about the Services; and
</p>
<p>
	(iv) Improve our Services.
</p>
<p>
	Once you begin using the Services through your Lemmino account, you will have the opportunity to include additional information in your account
	information, such as biographical and contact information. The use of any additional information you provide will be consistent with our use of any
	Personal Information you provide during the access approval process.
</p>
<p>
	1.3 Information We Collect From Visitors
</p>
<p>
	You are not required to register with the Services or provide any Personal Information to us to simply visit and browse our online or mobile Services.
	However, we may gather non-personal information about your visit solely for the purposes of monitoring and improving the Services.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2. Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<a name="a.1"></a>
	Although no data transmission can be guaranteed to be completely secure, Lemmino maintains strict physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard
	your Personal Information. These safeguards are reasonably designed to:
</p>
<p>
	(i) Insure the security and confidentiality of User records and information<a name="a.2"></a>;
</p>
<p>
	(ii) Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of User records and information; and<a name="a.3"></a>
</p>
<p>
	(iii) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of User records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any User.
</p>
<p>
	Your information is located on secure servers and encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We use transport layer security (TLS) when you sign
	into the Lemmino Services.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3. </strong>
	<strong>Information We Disclose</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties except to:
</p>
<p>
	(i) Affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by Lemmino) who may only use the Personal Information for the
	purposes described above.
</p>
<p>
	(ii) Our trusted service providers that are integral to the operation of the Services and provide services to you, including but not limited to payment
	processors, verification services, and third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your Personal Information. Our service providers are
	bound by law or contract to protect your Personal Information and are only allowed to use your Personal Information in accordance with our service
	agreements with them.
</p>
<p>
	(iii) Effect a merger or acquisition or to support the sale or transfer of business assets. If Lemmino is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all
	or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Services of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal
	Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
	(iv) Enforce our rights or protect our property; protect the rights, property or safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
	or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions. We may also disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in
	litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to
	law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>4. Cookies, Pixel Tags and Web Beacons</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	When you use our Services, we may collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web
	beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use the Services, your browser and devices communicate with servers managed by our business
	partners, our services providers or us to record the interactivity and to fulfill your requests for services and information.
</p>
<p>
	The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or devices, which are then
	transmitted back to our Services by your computers or devices. The cookies are managed by our business partners, our service providers, or us. For example,
	when you visit our Services, Lemmino and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or devices. They also help us to detect certain kinds of
	fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences,
	and your use of the Services. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Services activity with other information we store about you
	in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Services.
</p>
<p>
	Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to
	manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored
	on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
	information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences (e.g., the way Services pages
	or information is displayed).
</p>
<p>
	Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on Services pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific
	actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to our service providers or
	us. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our Services and services.
</p>
<p>
	We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to
	access our Services, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your
	system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record
	the IP addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Services. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate
	with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the Services you were visiting before you came to our Services and the Services you
	visit after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
</p>
<p>
	In many cases the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways and without any reference to Personal Information.
	For example, we use information we collect about Users to optimize our Services and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate
	the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that
	information.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive location information, we may collect that automatically. If we associate
	location information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy will govern how we would use that information.
</p>
<p>
	Lemmino sets and accesses our own cookies on our company-owned domains. We also use Google Analytics to track website and services analytics. If you wish
	to opt out of having cookies set on your browser or device as described above, you may manage the settings on your web browser to delete all cookies and
	disallow further acceptance of cookies. If you would like to opt out of third party tracking via Google Analytics, please visit
	https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Please note that disabling cookies may disable many of the features available through our Services. We therefore
	recommend that you leave cookies enabled. Because there is no industry standard, Lemmino does not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do
	Not Track signals.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>5. Collaboration and Sharing</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Our Services may offer certain features or tools that allow you to share your Content using our Services. Based on the permissions and settings you choose,
	the use of such features may enable the sharing of Content with people you want to collaborate with or with the general public. You can choose to change
	your settings at any time through your account. For more information about such sharing features, we encourage you to review the information provided on
	our website.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6. Choice and Opt Out</strong>

	We may you with the opportunity to opt out of having your Personal Information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information; however, this
	may limit your ability to fully use our Services. You may update your personal and security preferences by signing in to the Services with your Lemmino
	account. You may also opt out of email and promotional communications by following the instructions included in each such communication or by emailing us

	Lemmino will provide you with disclosures and alerts regarding this Privacy Policy by posting them on our Services, by emailing the email address listed in
	your Lemmino account (if you are a User), and/or by mailing to the physical address listed in your Lemmino account (once again, only if you are a User and

	a paper copy. Such disclosures and notices in relation to this Privacy Policy are deemed received by you within 24 hours of the time they are posted to our
	Services or emailed to you (unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered).
